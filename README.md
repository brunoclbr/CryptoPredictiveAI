I'm currently working on this project. The goal is to retrieve real-time data from Kraken and to use ML models to predict crypto prices. The prediciton will be hopefully increased by incorporating sentiment-analysis through a fine-tuned LLM. To ensure reproducibility and scalability the project is also implemented Kubernetes/Docker.
